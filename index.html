    <h1>Privacy Policy for ICP Analyzer Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024-06-15</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the "ICP Analyzer" Chrome extension ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our extension.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided API Keys:</strong> To use the extension, you must provide your own API keys for third-party AI services (such as OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Mistral). These keys are stored securely and locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API. They are never sent to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> When you activate the extension on a web page, we collect the text content from that page. This information is not stored by us and is only used to perform the analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> Your API keys are used solely to authenticate your requests with the third-party AI service you have selected.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> The text content from the web page is sent directly to the selected third-party AI service (e.g., OpenAI) for analysis. This is necessary to provide the core functionality of the extension, which is to generate an Ideal Customer Profile.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your data. We only share data in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We send the collected website content and your API key to the third-party AI service you choose for the purpose of analysis. We are not responsible for the data practices of these services. We encourage you to review their privacy policies:

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Your API keys are stored locally on your machine and are not accessible by us. We rely on the security measures provided by the Chrome browser and its storage API.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
